This app utilizes the MVC structure to accumulate a list of editable tasks!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, MongoDB

My learning was focused on making a simple UI and a smooth UX using MVC structure and storing/manipulating data in MongoDB.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I want to create more list item data inputs (eg. due date, etc.) I would love to convert it using React for structure and styling as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that creating a successful project, isn't determined by it's complexity. The MVC structure makes for a well-organized, easily maintainable app.
